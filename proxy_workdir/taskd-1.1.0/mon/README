Monitoring Scripts
------------------

These monitoring scripts create and update an rrdtool data file, then generate
several graphs from it.  There are three scripts, named:

  create
  update
  graph

The create script is run once to create the taskd.rrd file.

The update script and graph script are run hourly, at staggered times, and
update the taskd.rrd file.  They are run from cron like this:

  0   * * * * cd /home/taskd/mon && ./update ./taskd.rrd
  30 23 * * * cd /home/taskd/mon && ./graph  ./taskd.rrd
