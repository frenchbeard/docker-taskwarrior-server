GnuTLS Demo Programs
--------------------

The 'c' (client) and 's' (server) programs are based on public domain examples
from the GnuTLS release.  They are provided to illustrate how a client talks to
a server using GnuTLS.

GnuTLS 2.12.20 or later is assumed.

Build the source using:

  make

This demo sends a strings from the client (c) to the server (s).  The server
will display the string it received, and send it back to the client.  The client
will also display the string.  Here is an example of a successul test:

  # Launch the server in the background.

  $ ./s &
  [2] 10010

  # Run the client.  Both client and server display what was received from
  # the other.

  $ ./c
  s: 'This is a test.'
  c: 'This is a test.'

  # Terminate the server.
  $ fg
  ./s
  ^C
  $
